Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity per week, along with strength training exercises at least two days a week.</td>

        <td>Remember, it's important to focus on overall health and well-being 
            rather than just the number on the scale. A smart and sustainable approach to
             weight loss considers not only what you eat but also how you live your life and
              make choices that support long-term health and fitness.
